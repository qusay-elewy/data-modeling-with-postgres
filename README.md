# Data Modeling with Postgres

This project creates an ETL tool that extracts data from JSON files into Python objects in order to process and load them into a relational database that was created as part of the relational data modeling process.

Project instructions have been followed. First, the SQL queries were written in the sql_query.py file, then code was written and tested in the etl.ipynb file, then it was copied and adjusted in the etl.py file.

The etl.ipynb notebook was used to check if the data was loaded into our designed database. Test passed and the application successded to process and load the data.

To run this application, user needs to run python etl.py in terminal.
