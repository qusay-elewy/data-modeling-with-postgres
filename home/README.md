This is an ETL tool that extracts data from JSON files into Python objects in order to process them and load them into a relational database that was created as part of the relational data modeling process.

Foreign keys have not been added to our table for simplicity and because their creation was not covered in this course. However, code can be modified in the create SQL queries to add them to our tables.

Project instructions have been followed. First, the SQL queries were written in the sql_query.py file, then code was written and tested in etl.ipynb, then it was copied and adjusted in etl.py file.

etl.ipynb notebook was used to check if the data was loaded into our designed database. Test passed and the application successded to process and load the data.

To run this application, user needs to run python etl.py in terminal.
